The output video segmented with LRASPP have the higher overall and average FPS (0.539 FPS compared to 0.395 FPS with DeepLabV3). The reason why both of them achieved low FPS is that the models are running on CPU, which is not optimized for deep learning tasks, compared to GPU (cuda specifically).\n",
